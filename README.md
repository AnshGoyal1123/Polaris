# 🌌 Polaris

**Polaris** is a gamified iOS self-betterment app designed to help you track habits, define life goals, and visualize your progress across all major areas of your life — all through the metaphor of piloting a personal starship.

---

## 🚀 Concept

In *Polaris*, you are the voyager.

Your life is a spacecraft navigating toward **Polaris** — your ideal self. Each area of your life is a **ship system**, and your daily actions generate **Stardust** (XP) to fuel your journey. By completing habits, reaching waypoints, and reflecting weekly, you level up your systems and earn **Celestial Relics** to store in your **Stellar Archive**.

## 🧭 App Structure

Polaris uses a tab-based navigation system:

- **Mission Control** – Home hub showing daily Thrust (habit progress), Waypoints, and Stardust earned
- **Thrust** – Daily tracker for completing habits by pillar (Life Support, Navigation, etc.)
- **Polaris** – Long-term vision screen where you define your ideal self and next checkpoint for each pillar
- **Star Map** – Analytics dashboard with stats, streaks, and level tracking
- **Stellar Archive** – Gamified progress area for badges (Celestial Relics), Voyager Level, and system upgrades
